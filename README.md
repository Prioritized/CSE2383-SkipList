# CSE2383-SkipList

This project was an honors requirement for CSE 2383 Data Stuctures and Analysis of Algorithms at Mississippi State University.

## C++ Data Structure Implementations
Available here: [C++](./C++/)

Implements the skip list, binary search tree, and linked list data structures.

## Data Analysis
For the submitted project, the analysis was conducted using R.
I later replicated the analysis using Python as a learning exercise.
As a result, the two implementations are identical (excluding unreplicatable plot aesthetic options).

### R
>using R 3.3.2 and the ggplot2 package.

- code: [R](./R/)
- analysis: [R/SkipListAnalysis.md](./R/SkipListAnalysis.md)

### Python

>using Python 3.4 and the matplotlib, pandas, and numpy packages.

- code: [python](./python/)
- analysis: [python/markdown/analysis.md](./python/markdown/analysis.md)
