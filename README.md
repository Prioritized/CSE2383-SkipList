# CSE2383-SkipList

This was an honors project for CSE 2383 Data Stuctures and Analysis of Algorithms at Mississippi State University.

## C++ Data Structure Implementations
Available here: [/C++/](./C++/)

Implements the skip list, binary search tree, and linked list data structures.

## Data Analysis
Analysis was conducted using both R and Python. The analysis (and thus results) are identical. This was simply for me to get familiar with data analysis in Python so I tried to duplicate my results from R.

###R
>using R 3.3.2 and the ggplot2 package.

- code: [/R/](./R/)
- analysis: [/R/SkipListAnalysis.md](./R/SkipListAnalysis.md)

###Python

>using Python 3.4 and the matplotlib, pandas, and numpy packages.

- code: [/python/](./python/)  
- analysis: [/python/markdown/analysis.md](./python/markdown/analysis.md)
